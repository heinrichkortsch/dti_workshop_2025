# Acknowledgements

This resource is based on work originally done for the [Connected Interaction Kit](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/) at TU Delft by  [Adriaan Bernstein](https://bernstein.design), [Aadjan van der Helm](https://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/studiolab/vanderhelm/), and [Frederick Uebersch√§r](https://ueberschaer.design), with contributions from [Martin Havranek](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/m.c.havranek/).

Most of the changes and original texts for the DTI Summer School Workshop were created by [Adriaan Bernstein](https://bernstein.design) and are available on the website for last year's DTI 2024 workshop (https://adriaanb.github.io/dti_workshop/).

For the Summer School 2025, some sections (especially Part 2 and Part 3) have been carefully expanded, adapted, and complemented by Heinrich Kortsch to address the current course context and additional topics. All updates were made with great respect for the original concept and intent, ensuring continuity and clarity for new participants.

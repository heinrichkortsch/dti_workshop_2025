# Bonus: Reaction Game

On this page, you can find the code for a simple reaction game. 

This basic game makes use of two digital input components (for instance, a Tactile Switch), and an RGB LED as an output.

Once the LED turns white, both players have to try and touch their sensor as quick as possible. Whoever is faster wins the round, and the LED will  light up in the corresponding color (red or blue).

Try to see if you can understand the code and build a prototype that makes use of it. Feel free to use it as a basis for modification, creating your own game logic and behavior.


```python
##--- Imports
import digitalio
import board
import neopixel
import time
import random

##--- Variables
state_wait = 0
state_start_game = 1
state_wait_button_press = 2
state_red_wins = 3
state_blue_wins = 4
current_state = 0

# Button variables
red_pin = board.GP1
red_button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(red_pin)
red_button.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT

blue_pin = board.GP5
blue_button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(blue_pin)
blue_button.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT

# For the Chainable LED:
pin_leds = board.GP16
num_leds = 6
leds = neopixel.NeoPixel(pin_leds, num_leds, auto_write=False, pixel_order=neopixel.GRB)

led_off = (0, 0, 0, 0)
led_red = (255, 0, 0, 0)
led_blue = (0, 0, 255, 0)
led_white = (0, 0, 0, 255)

# Timer variables
timer_duration = 0
timer_mark = 0

##--- Functions
def set_led_color(color):
    global leds
    leds.fill(color)

# Tools and Equipment

These are the tools and equipment you need to get started:

### Raspberry Pi Pico W + Grove Shield
The Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller and the Grove Shield for Pi Pico form the hardware platform you will be using. When connected to your computer using a USB data cable, the Pi Pico W will appear as a storage device called `CIRCUITPY`.

### Your Computer + Mu Editor
You could, in theory, use any text editor to write programs for your microcontroller. In practice, you should always use a code editor, as it will simplify things greatly. The `Mu Editor` is free, open-source, and great for beginners. It spots errors, highlights important code passages, and helps structure your program. It has excellent `CircuitPython` support and offers important features for working with microcontrollers.

A tiny (0.66”) monochrome OLED screen. Perfect for short text-based outputs and simple UI elements.

## Background

The [Grove 0.66” OLED module](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-OLED-Display-0.66-SSD1306_v1.0/) is based on the popular SSD1306 display controller. This chip drives a **1-bit (black & white) OLED panel** with a resolution of **64×48 pixels**, meaning each pixel is either on or off. The module communicates over **I²C** and by default uses the address `0x3C`. Since the display has no built-in fonts or text features, all rendering is handled in software using CircuitPython’s [displayio](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-display-support-using-displayio/introduction) engine, which lets you draw text, shapes, or bitmaps to the screen.

## Preparation

To use the Grove OLED in your code, the `adafruit_displayio_ssd1306` and `adafruit_display_text` [libraries](../../glossary/glossary) are needed.

{: .highlight }
You can verify that the libraries are installed by ensuring a file called `adafruit_displayio_ssd1306.mpy` and a folder called `adafruit_display_text` are present in the `/lib` folder of your `CIRCUITPY` drive. If not, download Adafruit’s Library Bundle for Version 9.x [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Extract the needed files from the bundle and place them in the `/lib` folder on your microcontroller. You can learn more about libraries and their use in the [Glossary](../../glossary/glossary) or the [Tutorials](../../tutorials).

The examples below assume your module is connected to the Grove I²C header on **GP9/GP8** (SCL/SDA). Alternatively, you can use the second I²C port on **GP7/GP6**.

## Basic Usage

This example creates a simple text output consisting of two lines. Each line is defined as a label.Label [object](../../glossary/glossary), which specifies the font (`terminalio.FONT`), the text (`text="Hello,"`), the color (`color=0xFFFFFF`), and the x/y position in pixels on the screen. Both labels are added to a group, which is then assigned to the display as its `root_group`. The root group represents the “scene” for the display: Only the objects inside it will be drawn.

In the main loop, the text of the second label is updated by changing its `.text` property. CircuitPython automatically redraws the label whenever its content changes, so the screen is refreshed without any extra commands.

```python
# --- Imports
import time
import board
import busio
import displayio
import terminalio
from adafruit_display_text import label
import adafruit_displayio_ssd1306
from i2cdisplaybus import I2CDisplayBus


# --- Variables
line1 = label.Label(terminalio.FONT, text="Hello,", color=0xFFFFFF, x=2, y=8)
line2 = label.Label(terminalio.FONT, text="World!", color=0xFFFFFF, x=2, y=22)

# --- Functions


# --- Setup
displayio.release_displays()

i2c = busio.I2C(board.GP9, board.GP8)
display_bus = I2CDisplayBus(i2c, device_address=0x3C)
display = adafruit_displayio_ssd1306.SSD1306(display_bus, width=64, height=48)

group = displayio.Group()
group.append(line1)
group.append(line2)

display.root_group = group


# --- Main loop
while True:
    line2.text = "World!"
    time.sleep(0.5)
    line2.text = "World!_"
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

{: .note }
If you want to explore **different fonts**, you will also need to include the `adafruit_bitmap_font` library. This one is not included with your microcontroller and will need to be extracted from the [Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) for your CircuitPython version (9.x). See Adafruit’s [displayio guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-display-support-using-displayio/introduction) for details on working with fonts, bitmaps, and more advanced graphics.
